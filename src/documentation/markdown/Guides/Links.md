# Links

## Overview
Links are most often used for secondary actions that may navigate a user away from the core app experience. For example, you might place a link in app that takes a user to an external documentation / FAQ page or 3rd party website for more details.

Link buttons follow the same core principles as other buttons including height and horizontal padding dimensions ensuring a consistent click or tap surface area:
