Overview
Our overall layout is used to create high level consistency across our products and is comprised of three main elements: navigation, sidebar and content areas. 

Content areas in particular will change the most the most from product to product, adapting to fit the unique needs of a given view (more below). 

Though our products are built internally by separate teams, our end goal is for our customers to feel as if they're moving seamlessly between sections of a single product or experience – not jumping between products. 


Note: 

Our overall layout is designed for a maximum width of 1280px. The navigation bar and combined width of the sidebar and content area (including their outer margins), should not exceed this width. 

With a display width greater than 1280px, the navigation, sidebar and content area should be horizontally centered on the screen. 

Content Areas
Content areas are generally comprised of cards as the outermost containing element and can be used at various widths to support the needs of a given view. 

Do:

Use multiple content widths (wide, normal, narrow) within a single product, when it makes sense.

Use the normal width to maximize readability (i.e. for status updates or scheduled posts). 

Don't:

Use multiple content widths (wide, normal, narrow) within a single view or screen. 


Don't mix content widths within a single view or screen
Wide Content Area
A wide content area is best suited for experiences that need more screen space for a given task or UI. For example, charts or graphs (like those in Analyze), inboxes (like those in Reply) or full-screen publishing calendars (like those in Publish) are great examples where a wide content area makes sense. 


Normal Content Area
A normal content area is best suited for experiences which are content heavy or contain a lot of text. For example feeds or lists comprised of social media posts. The width of a normal content area has been designed for optimal readability with room for up 75 characters per line. 


Narrow Content Area
A narrow content area is best suited for single task UI like settings or configuration.
